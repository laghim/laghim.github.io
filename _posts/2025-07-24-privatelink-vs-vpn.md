When talking about providing a third-party vendor secure connectivity to your Azure services, both [Private Endpoints ](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/private-link/private-endpoint-overview) and [Virtual Network Gateway connections ](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/design)(commonly known as VPNs) aim to provide secure access, but they operate differently and carry distinct security implications. We'll evaluate key differences, taking into consideration the risk of the vendor being compromised.

**Private Endpoints** offer fine-grained, service-level access with no internet exposure and less maintenance overhead, whereas **VPN connectivity** extends a broader network trust boundary and can increase risk if not tightly controlled. Many see Private Link as a way to avoid the “give them an entire network pipe into my Azure environment” dilemma – you expose only what is needed. This can significantly reduce the blast radius if something goes wrong.

| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Network Exposure & Scope of Access | Only  exposes a specific resource over a private channel. The vendor’s network (or host) connects to one Azure service’s private IP.  There is no general network access beyond that service. This is a granular,  application-specific trust. For example, you could  expose only a particular Storage Account or Database via Private Link – the vendor cannot see or reach anything else in  your VNet. The service is effectively sandboxed to that single endpoint. | A  site-to-site (or point-to-site) VPN extends an entire network environment. By default, it’s like  placing the vendor’s machine on your internal network. Unless you implement  internal firewalls or VLAN segmentation, the vendor might technically be able  to attempt reaching multiple systems in the network, not just the intended  service. In other words, VPN tends to grant broad  network access (layer 3  connectivity) – which can increase risk if not  tightly controlled. Microsoft notes that traditional VPNs “give users access  to your entire environment,” whereas modern approaches allow more granular,  per-resource access. With VPN, careful network  segmentation and firewall rules are required to mimic the tight scope that a  Private Endpoint naturally has. |
| Internet Presence                  | The  Azure service does not have a public  address (or it’s disabled) when using Private  Link. No traffic goes out to the internet. This means an attacker on the  internet cannot even attempt to connect, and the vendor must connect via  private means (either from Azure or via a secure tunnel into Azure). Essentially,  the service is “dark” to the outside world. | The VPN  itself typically uses a public endpoint (for the VPN gateway or firewall) to  accept connections, although that can be locked down to specific IPs. And  once the VPN is established, the traffic goes through the encrypted tunnel.  The target service might still be a regular internal service or even a public  PaaS endpoint. If it’s a public PaaS (without Private Link), you’d rely on  firewall rules to allow only the VPN egress IP, for example. In summary, VPN  doesn’t inherently eliminate the service’s internet exposure unless combined  with other measures – it just provides an additional secure access path.  There’s also the maintenance of VPN credentials or certificates, and  potentially the risk of those being stolen (another vector to consider). |
| Setup and Maintenance              | For cross-tenant vendor access, you can use Azure’s built-in  Private Link approval process. The service  provider (you) creates a Private Endpoint or  shares a Private Link Service, and the consumer  (vendor) sets up a corresponding endpoint in  their Azure VNet. Azure handles the plumbing once approved. There’s no need to manage VPN appliances or connections for Azure-to-Azure scenarios. It’s largely firewall-friendly (uses  standard HTTPS/TCP) and is a one-time setup per service. DNS configuration is  an extra step (to ensure the service’s name resolves to the private IP) but  that’s an internal detail. | Requires  deploying a VPN Gateway or Network Virtual Appliance, exchanging keys or  certificates, and maintaining the tunnel. It’s a heavier infrastructure  setup. If the vendor doesn’t already have a compatible VPN device or is not  on Azure, this can add cost and complexity. VPNs also have scaling  considerations (throughput limits, tunnels count, etc.). In contrast, Private  Link leverages Azure’s platform without you managing a connection device. |
| Security Monitoring & Control      | Out-of-the-box,  network monitoring of the private link traffic is somewhat opaque – it’s  considered internal traffic. NSGs on the endpoint subnet are disabled by default for Private  Endpoint traffic (to ensure connectivity isn’t accidentally broken). This  means if you do nothing, the vendor’s traffic to the resource will bypass  subnet-level NSG checks. However, Azure allows enabling “Network policies for Private Endpoints” on the subnet; turning that on will let an NSG or user-defined  route (UDR) apply to that traffic. So you can enforce, for example, that the vendor’s source  IP (on-premises IP or Azure VNet IP) is allowed,  but nothing else – adding a layer of security. You can also use Azure Monitor  NSG Flow Logs or resource logs to watch the traffic. The key point is that additional configuration is needed to inspect or filter the  traffic at the network level, which we’ll  discuss more in mitigation strategies. By default, you trust that private  channel. On the positive side, the scope of what  you need to monitor is narrow (just one service) and you can also rely on the service’s own logging (e.g., Azure  SQL or Storage logs every access attempt). | A  VPN grants network-level access, so you’d likely put the vendor in a  segregated segment and use internal firewalls or NSGs to restrict what they  can do. This can be as secure, but it requires explicit design. You’d monitor  their activity potentially like any internal host – using NSG flow logs,  Azure Firewall logs (if funneling traffic), etc. One advantage is that many  organizations already have in-depth monitoring on their internal network, so  the vendor’s traffic could be subject to existing IDS/IPS systems when coming  through a VPN. On the other hand, because the access is broader, there’s a bigger area to watch. You  must be vigilant that the vendor isn’t accessing anything beyond what’s  permitted. |

In most cases, *Azure Private Endpoint is the recommended solution for third-party vendor access* due to its superior security posture (no public exposure, least-privilege network access) and integration into Azure’s ecosystem. It should be *combined with strong identity controls and monitoring to address supply chain risk*. Use Private Link’s features: require explicit approval for the connection, and periodically re-verify that need.

*Avoid giving broad network VPN access unless there is no other viable way*. VPN connectivity can be made secure, but it demands *rigorous internal network segmentation* and is r*iskier if the vendor’s environment is breached*. If VPN is used, limit it to only the necessary subnet or use firewall rules so that the vendor’s IP can only talk to the one target IP/port, effectively mirroring the Private Link scope (this is possible with custom VPN configurations and NSGs).
