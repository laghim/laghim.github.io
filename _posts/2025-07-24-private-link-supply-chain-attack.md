[Azure Private Link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/private-link/private-link-overview) (together with [Private Endpoints](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/private-link/private-endpoint-overview)) offers a way to expose a service privately, without a public internet endpoint. This is appealing for minimizing exposure, but it raises the question: **What if the trusted vendor itself is breached?** Supply chain attacks are a serious concern. In such attacks, a malicious actor exploits the trust and access given to a third-party to penetrate the primary target’s environment.

A **supply-chain attack** is a cyberattack that exploits vulnerabilities in the software or hardware provided by a third-party vendor to compromise a target organization. Instead of directly attacking the target, attackers infiltrate the supply chain to access systems and data, often through compromised software updates or malicious components. These attacks can be also known as “value-chain attacks” or “third-party attacks.”

## Azure Private Endpoint & Private Link - Secure Private Connectivity

[**Azure Private Link**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/private-link/private-endpoint-overview) is a service that maps an Azure resource directly into your virtual network (VNet) via a private interface (called a Private Endpoint). The Private Endpoint is essentially a network interface with a private IP address from your VNet, associated with the specific Azure service instance. This makes the service appear as if it’s inside your own network.

Key characteristics include:

- **No public internet exposure:** Traffic to the service travels entirely over the Azure backbone network, not the public internet. The service’s public IP can be disabled. This dramatically shrinks the attack surface, as would-be attackers cannot reach the resource from the internet.
- **Access scoped to the endpoint:** Only clients with network access to that VNet (or peered VNets/connected on-premises networks) can reach the service via the private IP. Even then, they must know the proper private DNS name or address. This restricts access to approved network paths.
- **One-way initiation**: Connections over Private Endpoints are initiated by the client towards the service. This client-initiated model provides inherent control — the vendor can only access what you explicitly expose and approve.
- **Integration with Azure network controls**: Private Endpoints can work with internal network controls. For example, you can attach Network Security Groups (NSGs) to the endpoint’s subnet to restrict permitted ports or IP ranges. This means you could allow the vendor’s specific IP ranges and block others at the network level.
- **No need for VPN/ExpressRout**e: Because Private Link keeps the traffic on Azure’s private network, you don’t necessarily need a VPN or ExpressRoute circuit to get private access. If the vendor is also on Azure (in their own tenant), they can consume your Private Link directly via their VNet. If they are on-premises, a VPN/ExpressRoute can be used in combination to reach Azure, but the service still doesn’t require a public endpoint.

In summary, Private Endpoints provide a *private, isolated connection* to an Azure service, effectively extending your network boundary to include that service.

However, *private* doesn’t automatically mean *safe*. It protects against external scans and direct internet attacks, but what if the “trusted” side (the vendor) is where the threat comes from?

Compromised third-party vendor with secure access to an Azure service



## Security Considerations When a Vendor Is Compromised (Supply Chain Attack Scenario)

Even with a Private Endpoint in place, one must plan for the worst-case scenario: *the third-party vendor’s system is compromised by an attacker.* In a supply-chain attack, this is precisely the attacker’s strategy — target the weaker link to get to the stronger target. Let’s break down what could happen and how to reduce the risk:

**Scenario:** *You have granted Vendor X access to an Azure resource (say, a database or storage account) via a Private Endpoint. Vendor X’s laptop or Azure VM or on-prem server that connects to this endpoint gets infected or taken over by an attacker (through phishing, malware, etc.). Now the attacker has whatever network privileges Vendor X had.*

### Common questions that arise

- **Q1: Can the attacker reach your resource?** If Vendor X’s machine/user was already authorized to use the Private Endpoint, the attacker, impersonating them, can now initiate the same connection. The Private Endpoint itself doesn’t perform user authentication — it’s a network tunnel. So **from a network perspective, yes**, the attacker can reach the service over the private connection (assuming they also can resolve the private DNS name or know the target IP).

  

  >  It’s important to note that network access is not the only defense for the resource. Azure services will still enforce their normal authentication/authorization.*

![networkindentity](/assets/images/networkindentity.png)

For example, an Azure SQL DB will require valid [SQL credentials/Entra token](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-sql/database/authentication-aad-configure?view=azuresql&tabs=azure-portal); a Storage Account will require keys or [SAS token](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-sas-overview) or[ Entra auth](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/authorize-access-azure-active-directory). *Ideally, the vendor was given its own limited credentials to the resource.* If those credentials are compromised along with the machine, the attacker can then query data or perform operations as that vendor. However, if the vendor’s credentials are separate and not stored on that machine (or use MFA), the attacker *might have network access but no valid credentials to login to the resource.* This is why **identity security matters as much as network security.**

- **Q2: Could the attacker use that Private Endpoint to reach other resources in your VNet?** By default, no. The Private Endpoint connection is internally mapped only to the specific resource. The attacker cannot use it as a general VPN into your network. They can’t, for instance, start scanning your subnet or hit other IPs — the private link is essentially a point-to-point connection for that service — limits lateral movement. In contrast, if the vendor had a full VPN into a subnet and got compromised, an attacker could try to move laterally to other systems. Private Link’s design prevents that; the attacker is stuck targeting the one service.



### Potential risks if the vendor is compromised

- **R1. Data Exfiltration or Misuse**: The attacker could attempt to extract sensitive data from the resource (e.g., download all storage blobs, run queries on the database) using the vendor’s access. If the vendor’s access was supposed to be read-only, hopefully the damage is limited to data theft; if they had write or admin access, the attacker could even alter or delete data.
- **R2. Brute Forcing and Service Exploits:** With network access, an attacker could try exploiting vulnerabilities in the target service (for instance, a zero-day in SQL or a misconfiguration). They could also try brute-forcing credentials if any additional auth is required.
- **R3. Pivoting (Limited):** As noted, pivoting is limited with Private Endpoint. But one concern is if the resource itself, once compromised, could lead deeper. For example, if it’s an app service behind Private Endpoint that has more trusted connections to other services, like a database. Ensure that the resource exposed via Private Link is hardened and isolated (principle of least privilege for that resource).



### HOW TO PREVENT OR CONTAIN A BREACH VIA PRIVATE LINK AND PRIVATE ENDPOINT

Microsoft’s guidance for such scenarios revolves around a layered approach, often summarized as **Zero Trust principles:** **“use least privilege, assume breach, verify explicitly”**. Concretely, here are best practices and mitigations:

**1. Strong Identity and Access Management:** Do not rely solely on network location for security. Use Azure Entra ID or service-specific credentials that are unique to the vendor. See more details about [Identity Management Security](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/fundamentals/identity-management-overview).

- Give the vendor the least privileges needed on the resource (e.g., if they only need to read a certain container, scope their access to that). This way, even if compromised, the attacker’s actions are constrained. For instance, use Azure RBAC roles on a storage account to restrict what their identity can do.
- Use [Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/fundamentals/identity-management-overview) and conditional access for any logins if the service supports Azure Entra ID. This reduces chance that stolen credentials alone are enough.
- Monitor and log access at the identity level: enable [resource logs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/fundamentals/identity-management-overview) (e.g., Storage Access logs, SQL audit logs) to detect anomalies like large data downloads or queries from the vendor account at odd hours.

**2. Apply Network Security Controls to the Private Endpoint:** As mentioned, by default the vendor’s traffic flows freely to the resource once the endpoint is set up. To tighten this:

- [Enable NSG on the Private Endpoint’s subnet](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/private-link/disable-private-endpoint-network-policy?tabs=network-policy-portal) with appropriate rules. You can restrict source IPs or ranges allowed. If the vendor connects via a known static IP or comes from an on-premises range over VPN, whitelist only that. Block all other sources. This ensures an attacker not coming from the vendor’s usual network can’t use the endpoint. (If the attacker is actually in the vendor’s network, they would still appear as that IP — but at least you cut off other paths.)
- Use [Azure Firewall](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/firewall/overview) or a [Network Virtual Appliance (NVA)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/networking/guide/network-virtual-appliance-high-availability) to inspect traffic, if appropriate. Because Private Endpoint traffic can bypass traditional network inspection, one strategy is to force that traffic through a firewall. Azure Firewall can be configured in the hub of a [hub-and-spoke ](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/networking/guide/network-virtual-appliance-high-availability)topology such that any access to the Private Endpoint goes via the firewall (using user-defined routes). On [Azure Firewall Premium](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/firewall/premium-features), you could even enable intrusion detection or filtering of SQL injection patterns, etc., in the traffic. This adds cost/complexity but provides deep packet inspection that would catch malware being sent over the channel. *If you cannot deploy an inline firewall in Azure, ensure the vendor’s end has robust endpoint security (since the traffic originates there).*
- [Private Endpoint Connection Approval](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/private-link/manage-private-endpoint?tabs=manage-private-link-powershell#private-endpoint-connections): Azure Private Link has a feature where all new private endpoint connections to your service require manual approval. That way, if someone from a different environment (or an attacker setting up another Azure VM pretending to be Vendor) tries to connect, it won’t activate without your consent.

**3. Monitoring and Anomaly Detection:**

- [Azure Monitor](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/fundamentals/overview) and [Sentinel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/overview?tabs=defender-portal): Set up monitoring on the resource and network. For example, use Azure Monitor to create alerts if unusually high data volume is transferred or if access comes at a non-standard time. As a cloud-native SIEM, Sentinel can correlate signals — e.g., notice if the vendor’s account downloads far more data than ever before, or if the NSG logs show the vendor’s IP making suspicious connection attempts.

**4. Regular Auditing of Access:** Periodically review which private endpoints are connected to your resource and verify that the vendor still needs the access. If the project with the vendor is done, remove the connection. This reduces lingering risk.

**5. Endpoint Hardening:**

- If the private endpoint connects to an Azure PaaS (like Azure SQL or Storage), you mainly focus on **identity** and **network** as above. But if it connects to an Azure IaaS or a service you host (like a [Private Link Service fronting a VM or an App](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/private-link/private-link-service-overview)), ensure that host is secured (patched, running [Defender for Endpoint ](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-endpoint/zero-trust-with-microsoft-defender-endpoint)with antivirus capabilities, etc.). That way if an attacker tries to exploit the application after gaining network access, they hit a hardened target.
- Consider enabling [Microsoft Defender for Cloud](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/defender-for-cloud-introduction) with specific [CSPM plans](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/concept-cloud-security-posture-management#plan-availability). For instance, [Defender for Storage](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/defender-for-storage-introduction) can detect unusual data access patterns or malware uploads, and Defender for SQL can detect SQL injection attempts or anomalous queries. These can act as tripwires if an attacker is active inside the vendor channel.



## Conclusion

In essence, **do not implicitly trust the vendor’s network just because it connects over a private link.** Treat that connection as you would an untrusted entry, but one that is limited and can be heavily monitored.

Microsoft’s stance is that Zero Trust principles should extend to third-party access: *assume breach* (the vendor might get breached), so limit what that breach can do (*least privilege & network segmentation*) and have detections in place.
